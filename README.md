# GBBC-FEM

## Overview
The open-source MATLAB package is a finite element program used for calculating the eigenmodes of high-symmetry photonic crystals. The program employs generalized Bloch boundary conditions based on group theory, which allows for computations in smaller domain compared to conventional finite element methods.

## Usage
`MBBC-FEM(2D TM)`: A case study using MBBC-FEM to calculate the eigenmodes of photonic crystals.
`MBBC-FEM(2D TM)/OriginalModel(TM).mph`: COMSOL model of two-dimensional photonic crystal.
`MBBC-FEM(2D TM)/FemMain.m`ï¼šMain program that the mirror symmetry's character equals 1.
`MBBC-FEM(2D TM)/FemMain2.m`: Main program that the mirror symmetry's character equals -1.

### Run examples
Run the script `FemMain.m`/`FemMain2.m` to visualize the results.
